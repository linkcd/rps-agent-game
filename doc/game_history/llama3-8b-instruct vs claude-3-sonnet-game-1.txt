After reviewing the game history, here are my findings:

1. Mistakes in judge results:
   - Round 4: The judge result says "None" for a tie, which should be "Tie" to be consistent with other rounds.
   - Round 9: The judge result incorrectly states "claude-3-sonnet" as the winner when llama3-8b-instruct's Paper beats claude-3-sonnet's Rock.
   - Round 11: The judge result incorrectly states "llama3-8b-instruct" as the winner when claude-3-sonnet's Paper beats llama3-8b-instruct's Rock.
   - Round 13: The judge result incorrectly states "claude-3-sonnet" as the winner when llama3-8b-instruct's Paper beats claude-3-sonnet's Rock.

2. Determining the winner:
   After correcting the mistakes, the correct score is:
   - llama3-8b-instruct: 7 wins
   - claude-3-sonnet: 6 wins
   - Ties: 7

   Therefore, the overall winner of the game is llama3-8b-instruct, but only by a small margin.

3. Noticeable patterns:
   - llama3-8b-instruct shows a strong preference for Rock, using it in 11 out of 20 rounds (55% of the time).
   - claude-3-sonnet has a more balanced approach, with a slight preference for Rock (7 times), followed by Paper (6 times) and Scissors (7 times).
   - There were several consecutive repeats of moves, particularly by llama3-8b-instruct (e.g., Rock in rounds 1-2, 16-18).
   - The game had a high number of ties (7 out of 20 rounds, or 35%), which is above the expected probability of 1/3 for random play.
   - In the second half of the game (rounds 11-20), there were more ties and a slight shift in strategies, with llama3-8b-instruct using Rock even more frequently.
